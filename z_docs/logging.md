# TinyTwin Flags

- `-T`: Number of taps of UL and DL convolution

## Logging MAC and PHY level metrics

TTI level logging:
- `-S`: Log UL SNR 
- `-Q`: Log DL CQI 
- `-P`: Log cumulative gNB throughput in  UL and DL both
- `-X`: Logs whether MAC level ReTransmissions (UL and DL) occur in a given TTI. Also logs the MCS of the transmission across a given TTI.

Will move to the config file soon.
